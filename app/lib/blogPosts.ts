    <h2>Getting Around: Private Transfers in Cairns & Tropical North Queensland</h2>

    <p>Exploring the region is easiest with <strong>pre-booked private airport transfers, hotel pickups and door-to-door shuttles</strong>. Popular routes include:</p>

    <div class="md-card md-card-soft">
      <ul class="md-list-tight">
        <li><a href="https://www.spltransportation.com.au/transfers/cairns-airport-to-port-douglas">Cairns Airport → Port Douglas</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.spltransportation.com.au/transfers/cairns-airport-to-palm-cove">Cairns Airport → Palm Cove</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.spltransportation.com.au/transfers/cairns-airport-to-cairns-city">Cairns Airport → Cairns City</a></li>
        <li>Cairns City → Kuranda / Skyrail</li>
        <li>Cairns City → Mission Beach</li>
        <li>Cairns City → Atherton Tablelands &amp; Paronella Park</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Booking a private transfer means your driver is waiting when you land, your vehicle is sized correctly for your group and luggage, and your price is fixed in advance in Australian dollars. It’s the most comfortable, stress-free way to start or end your trip in Tropical North Queensland.</p>

    <p>If you're planning to visit several of the locations above, consider grouping attractions by direction — for example, a northern beaches and Port Douglas day, a Kuranda and Skyrail day, and a southern tablelands and Paronella Park day — and arranging transfers or tours accordingly.</p>
